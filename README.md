# Project Title:  Head-2-Head Community Analysis

## Project Breakdown:
This project investigates discrepancies in community engagement and raises concerns about the suitability of a specific individual for the Community Ambassador role. The analysis is based on verifiable Campfire data and personal experience hosting and attending events. The project is divided into two main analyses:

BPL vs. ABC Participation: This analysis compares event check-in data between the BPL and a new group (ABC) to demonstrate a significant difference in community engagement.  The analysis highlights a period of low BPL participation (five or fewer check-ins per event) until after the author parted ways with the BPL.  Following this separation, their attendance, particularly at Wednesday events, increased. This sudden change in attendance raises questions about the motivations behind their increased participation.

Individual Attendance Comparison: Using Campfire check-in data, it demonstrates that the author attended significantly more events (three times as many) than competing candidates. This analysis is further broken down by day of the week to highlight inconsistencies in attendance. Additionally, it reveals that the candidate did not attend a single Community Day event since at least April, despite hosting one.

The data for both analyses is publicly available on GitHub and can be verified using the Campfire API.

## Conclusion:
This project provides data-driven evidence of discrepancies in community engagement within the Community. The analyses strongly suggest a lack of consistent involvement and commitment from XCandidate, the individual now accepted for the Community Ambassador role. The timing of the CA's increased attendance, coinciding with the apparent acceptance of their application, raises further questions. The data presented, including comparisons of overall attendance, day-of-the-week attendance, and participation in key event types (like Community Days), casts doubt on their suitability to represent the community. This project underscores the importance of data transparency and rigorous evaluation when selecting community leaders.
